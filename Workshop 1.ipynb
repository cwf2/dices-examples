    "# Introduction to the Python DICES client\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first workshop, we’re going to look at how to retrieve and work with DICES data inside a Python script. While the web interface can be helpful for browsing and exploring the data, more complicated tasks are better suited to a script. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- when your search has several steps, and you want to make sure they're done in a specific order\n",
    "- when you want to repeat an operation many times and collate the results\n",
    "- when you have to connect information from different sources, like DICES, Perseus, MANTO, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The DICES API\n",
    "\n",
    "You could, if you wanted, examine the machine-oriented version of the database manually using your web-browser. A separate set of URLs provides access to the same data, but without the human-friendly tables, drop-downs and buttons. For example, compare the two pages below. Both represent the same search, for speeches by Jason.\n",
    "\n",
    "- for humans: http://csa20211203-005.uni-rostock.de/app/speeches?spkr_name=Jason\n",
    "- for machines: http://csa20211203-005.uni-rostock.de/api/speeches?spkr_name=Jason\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine-actionable API is provided by Django Web Framework. If you’re interested in working with the API directly or have questions or suggestions about its implementation, please feel free to let us know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The DICES client\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, working with URLs like the one above and parsing the JSON responses from the server isn’t something you want to have to deal with. The [Python DICES client](https://github.com/cwf2/dices-client) provides a wrapper around the API that lets you make requests and manipulate the results using Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "The client provides a class, **DicesAPI**, which allows you to manage your connection to the database. This is how you request data; it also lets you specify a custom server, in case you’re running your own mirror of the database. The first part of this tutorial will cover searching the database and manipulating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Records as objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The client provides some basic class definitions that represent the records in the database as objects: speeches, characters, works, etc. Each class comes with properties and methods to help make common tasks straightforward, for example, filtering a collection of speeches based on speaker or language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll look at each of the classes in turn below and cover their specific properties and methods in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the basic mechanisms for querying the database and working with DICES records, we’re continuing to build out a suite of ancillary tools for specialized tasks, often associated with external linked data. For example, the `manto` module provides some basic methods for linking speech data to the MANTO database, while `text` provides shortcuts for downloading the text of the speeches from Perseus and processing them with CLTK. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the selection is small, and centred on the tasks that we wanted to do ourselves. We’re very interested to hear from you about potential additions or improvements to existing modules, or suggestions for entire new modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thanks for beta testing!\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these tools are under active development. We expect to discover bugs and inconsistencies as the user base expands, and we’re very grateful to you for helping us in this regard! Our goal is to support your research, and in the process, to make sure that future scholars are able to replicate and expand upon your work.\n",
