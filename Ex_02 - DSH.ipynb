    "The speech between Euyalus and his mom is missing from the database. That's because as of this writing we don't have a systematic way of including anonymous characters like her--folks described only by a family relation or an occupation. Because the character doesn't fit our current data model, she gets omitted, and this speech fails to be added to the database.\n",

    "The conversation between Hera and the gods is there in the database, but the speaker-addressee pairs are not registering as mother-child relationships. In this case, it's because \"gods\" isn't being parsed as including all the individual gods, but rather a corporate entity that doesn't have \"mother\" or \"child\" as properties. This highlights another issue that needs to be resolved in our data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the conversation between Jupiter and his mom is also in the database, and each of these characters is matched with a WikiData entity, but we're not getting the right answer about their kinship relation because WikiData has distinct entities for the Greek goddess Rhea and the Phrygian goddess Cybele. We can fix this by pointing the character's WikiData ID to the Greek goddess instead (as we did for the Roman deities), but maybe we should think about the larger problem of poetic ambiguity/metonymy/syncretism."

We hope that MANTO, because it's specific to Classical myth and hand-curated by domain experts, can help us with problems like when to treat Cybele and Rhea as independent entities and when to consider them identical."
